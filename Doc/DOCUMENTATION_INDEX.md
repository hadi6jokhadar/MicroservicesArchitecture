## 🗂️ Project Folder Structure

The `src/` directory has two distinct sub-folders:

| Folder          | Role                                                                   | Current projects                                             |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `src/Services/` | Core platform microservices. Foundational — other Apps depend on them. | Identity, Tenant, FileManager, Notification, Translation, Category, AI |
| `src/Apps/`     | Domain-specific application projects that consume platform Services.   | Nasheed                                                      |

**Every project in `src/Apps/` must have its own `Doc/` folder** with at minimum: `DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md`, `OVERVIEW.md`, `ENTITIES_AND_DATA_MODEL.md`, `API_ENDPOINTS.md`. See `NEW_SERVICE_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` for the full required file list.

2. ✅ .md file removed → Remove entry
3. ✅ File purpose changes → Update description
4. ✅ File renamed → Update filename

**How to update:**

1. Keep alphabetical order within each category
2. Keep descriptions concise (1-2 sentences)
3. Keep "Read When" specific and actionable
4. Update "Total Files" count
5. Update "Last Updated" date

### File Count Check

```powershell
# Run this to verify file count matches index
cd Doc
(Get-ChildItem -Filter "*.md").Count
# Should match "Total Files" above
```

## ✅ Quick Reference for AI Agents

**Before reading any documentation:**

1. ✅ Am I reading DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md first? If no, **stop and read this file first**
2. ✅ Do I know which specific files I need? If no, **use Quick Task Lookup table above**
3. ✅ Am I about to read 10+ files? If yes, **you're reading too much, be more specific**

**Remember:**

- 📖 **One file = One topic = Complete information**
- 🚫 **No "quick" files exist** - all content is in the main guide
- ⚡ **Read only what you need** - don't read everything
- 🔄 **Always check this index** - don't assume files exist
